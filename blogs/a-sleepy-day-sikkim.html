                        As I stood in front of the buzzing crowd at the Gangtok
                        round of Behes, India’s largest school debate platform,
                        I felt a mixture of excitement and nerves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I had been part of debate competitions before, but this
                        one was different—it was Behes, a place where young
                        minds from all over the country gather to engage in
                        thought-provoking conversations. This wasn’t just
                        another event; it was an opportunity to challenge
                        myself, make new friends, and grow in ways I hadn’t
                        anticipated.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        It all started when my school invited me to participate.
                        Behes had a reputation for being one of the top
                        platforms for school debate in the country, and just the
                        thought of being part of it was both thrilling and
                        intimidating. Our team immediately started preparing,
                        and with the help of our school’s dedicated debate
                        coach, we spent long hours researching, practicing, and
                        strategizing for the rounds ahead.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The excitement was real, but so was the pressure. I
                        remember questioning myself—would I be able to stand out
                        among so many talented debaters? But as our coach
                        reminded us, Behes wasn’t only about winning or losing;
                        it was about the learning journey. The team behind Behes
                        had built a reputation as a debate company that didn’t
                        just host competitions, but also nurtured a love for
                        debate and critical thinking in students.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On the first day of the event, walking into the venue
                        was like stepping into a different world. There were
                        hundreds of students from different schools, all equally
                        excited and nervous. The energy in the room was
                        infectious, and even before the debates began, you could
                        tell that this was going to be an unforgettable
                        experience. Behes is more than just a debate
                        competition—it's a place where ideas are exchanged
                        freely, and every participant is encouraged to think
                        deeply about the world around them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As the debates started, I quickly realized just how
                        challenging—and rewarding—this experience was going to
                        be. Each round presented new topics, some of which I had
                        never thought about before. The format of the
                        competition kept us on our toes, forcing us to think
                        critically and adapt quickly. The structure of the
                        debates, built carefully by the debate company behind
                        Behes, pushed us to consider both sides of the argument
                        with fairness and depth.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At first, I found myself stumbling through a few rounds,
                        trying to find my rhythm. But with each debate, I became
                        more confident. The feedback from the judges, many of
                        whom were experienced debaters, was incredibly helpful.
                        They didn’t just tell us what we did wrong—they
                        explained how we could improve, whether it was the
                        structure of our arguments, the clarity of our points,
                        or our ability to listen and respond to the other team’s
                        case.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Debating at Behes was about much more than just speaking
                        well. It was about understanding the nuances of each
                        issue and crafting arguments that were well-reasoned and
                        evidence-based. But one of the most important lessons I
                        learned wasn’t just about debate technique—it was about
                        empathy. Every debate challenged me to see things from a
                        perspective different from my own, to consider
                        viewpoints I might not have otherwise explored. That, to
                        me, is what school debate is really about: learning to
                        engage with ideas openly and thoughtfully.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        What I didn’t expect, though, was how many friendships I
                        would make along the way. The competition was intense,
                        but the camaraderie between participants was even
                        stronger. Whether we were competing against each other
                        or cheering each other on, there was a sense of mutual
                        respect and shared passion. In between rounds, we would
                        chat, laugh, and share stories about our debates. It
                        didn’t matter that we were from different schools or
                        cities—what connected us was a love for debate and a
                        genuine curiosity about the world. There were people
                        from Kalimpong and Darjeeling there - and I am still in
                        touch with them even though we are working
                        professionals!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These friendships turned out to be one of the most
                        rewarding parts of my Behes experience. In just a few
                        days, I met people who I know will remain friends for
                        years to come. Even though we were competing, there was
                        a sense of unity in knowing we were all there to learn,
                        challenge ourselves, and grow.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As the final rounds wrapped up and the winners were
                        announced, I couldn’t help but reflect on how much I had
                        gained from this experience even though I wasn’t even in
                        the top 30. We didn’t win anything, but I walked away
                        with something far more valuable—an enhanced love for
                        debate, newfound skills, and a deeper understanding of
                        myself and others.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Looking back, Behes was far more than just a debate
                        company organizing a school debate competition. It was a
                        platform that encouraged me to step out of my comfort
                        zone and engage with important issues in a meaningful
                        way. The experience has only strengthened my passion for
                        debate, and I can’t wait to take part in future
                        competitions. I even hope to mentor younger debaters one
                        day, sharing with them the lessons I’ve learned along
                        the way.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For anyone who loves debating or is curious about the
                        world, I can’t recommend Behes enough. It’s more than
                        just a competition—it’s a chance to challenge yourself,
                        learn from others, and build lasting connections. The
                        memories, friendships, and skills you gain will stay
                        with you long after the competition ends.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At its core, Behes is more than just a school debate
                        event. It’s a community, one that brings together
                        passionate young minds, fosters respectful discourse,
                        and shapes the thinkers and leaders of tomorrow. I’m
                        grateful to have been a part of it, and I know that my
                        time at Behes will always hold a special place in my
                        heart.
