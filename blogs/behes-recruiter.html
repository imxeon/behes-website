                      <p class="lead">
                        I was supposed to reach Bhopal Junction at 4:30 AM and I
                        was hoping my train would be at least a few hours late,
                        so as to not get caught unawares in Madhya Pradesh
                        during odd hours.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To pass time, I get acquainted with a fellow passenger
                        from Vijayawada, working and studying in Delhi. Daniel,
                        a young doctor, was real worried about the Covid-19
                        outbreak and I couldn't help but be a little concerned,
                        myself, going by what he had to say. I won't forget his
                        sombre tone as he speculated about a techie from
                        Bangalore, who tested positive for the novel
                        Coronavirus, touring the southern states, leaving who
                        knows how many infected people in his wake. And who all
                        amongst them would unknowingly facilitate the spread of
                        this ongoing pandemic.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I should have guessed this Behes recruitment trip would
                        be my last for a long time. However, back then, it was
                        just a somewhat serious conversation with a fellow
                        traveler, so as to not fall asleep and miss the station.
                        Little did we know, within 20 days, most of the world
                        would follow the procedures to combat a health
                        emergency.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Despite his serious demeanour, Daniel proved to be good
                        company and I did not even realise when the train pulled
                        into the station. 5 minutes before its scheduled
                        arrival. And I was counting on Indian Railways to abide
                        by its stereotype.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I frantically remember the train is supposed to get
                        going in 2 minutes. Which gives me just about enough
                        time to wish Daniel well, as I put my shoes on, and
                        retrieve my luggage carefully without bumping into other
                        passengers who are fast asleep. As I walk towards the
                        door to exit the coach, I think hard. Feels like I am
                        forgetting something, but can't put my finger on it. I
                        wave that discomforting thought away, I tell myself that
                        I am being a bit too over cautious, and keep walking
                        towards the exit. Daniel proves to be a life saver as he
                        comes after me to pass me my guitar case. Whoops, that
                        would have been quite the loss. Thank you, Daniel!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The gentleman walking ahead is nice enough to hold the
                        self closing door of the AC coach, open for me, letting
                        in the smell of the railway station. A familiar smell,
                        ever since Behes required me to be on the move;
                        travelling once a month, spending around 2 weeks in
                        places I haven't been to.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I killed my time in the waiting room, planning my day. A
                        large TV played the news and the train announcements
                        were being made simultaneously, both of which were of no
                        use to me. In an attempt to drown the noise, I put on my
                        ear phones and tune in to some familiar music so that I
                        could get my thoughts in order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For starters, I book a room for the next few days. I
                        take note of the details on my phone. I had to check
                        which school, amongst the ones on my list, was closest
                        to my room. I calculate cab fares and did some research
                        on the schools I had to visit apart from the five I had
                        already scheduled a meeting with, in the next two days.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I managed to squeeze in an hour's worth of uninterrupted
                        sleep before hitting the road, again. Armed with around
                        10 Behes booklets and a somewhat formal attire, I reach
                        Sanskaar Valley School, about 10 kms from the outskirts
                        of Bhopal, right between two dams. So whatever little
                        pollution reaches this place is swept away by the
                        constant breeze created by the surrounding water.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The way to the school, from my room in MP Road, tested
                        the strength of the auto-rickshaw ferrying me, as we
                        trudged uphill after crossing a forest. When you're in a
                        new town, it is always recommended to build a
                        conversation with the auto waale bhaiyya. And I, as
                        usual, try to rehearse my pitch with the cheerful
                        bhaiyya. They always are intrigued with the idea behind
                        Behes. Realising that there is little chance of me
                        catching another ride back, I ask him if he is open to
                        me renting his, and the trustworthy auto's, services for
                        the entire day; he readily agrees.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As we head downhill towards the school gates, I see
                        flowers in a wave of colours within the campus, standing
                        out in the midst of a mostly dry and pale landscape.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The auto bhaiyya knows his way around the school grounds
                        and drops me off at the reception, so that I may enquire
                        about the whereabouts of the dean. After a brief wait, a
                        gentleman escorts me to the other block, across a lush
                        football field, where the dean's office was located. The
                        dean turned out to be a man of few words and within 10
                        minutes, after several logistical queries, he accepted
                        our proposal to host Behes' Bhopal round at the school,
                        after the summer break.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On the walk back uphill towards my cheery auto waale
                        bhaiyya, I looked back and could visualise tense
                        students heading towards their respective debate rooms,
                        set in such a scenic location, looking like they mean
                        business.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Auto wale bhaiya sure seemed to know his way around the
                        local educational institutions. When I tell him our next
                        destination is Sagar Public School (SPS) he flaunts his
                        knowledge by confidently, and correctly, naming the
                        principal. He further tells me he knows the person in
                        charge at St. Joseph's School, and that we should head
                        there, as well, once I am done.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I do some quick thinking and since I have about 2 hours
                        before my next meeting at SPS, decide to visit Brother
                        Verguise, bhaiyya's contact. I apprise him of my change
                        in plans and when I express mild panic as to whether we
                        would be able to pull it off or not, he calmly tells me
                        to not worry as St. Joseph's is on the way to SPS.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Auto wale bhaiya was probably in his mid 50s, with a
                        strong build to show for it. I couldn't help but notice
                        the cane he used, at Sanskar Valley, to walk around and
                        ask enquire about his limp.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He said he was in Raipur when it happened. It was
                        raining cats and dogs and he had already parked his
                        two-wheeler inside. It was a dark night and for some
                        reason he went out on the road when a passing vehicle
                        hit him. In an attempt to get away quickly, the panic
                        stricken driver ran over his leg. The next thing he
                        remembered, after the excruciating pain, was doctors
                        around him discussing amputation. But he vehemently
                        refused. There was no way he would have let them sever
                        his leg, he told me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I shared with him about my knee injury from last year
                        and how it affected my day to day life. Well, turns out
                        that was not the only similarity we shared. We both
                        agreed that Indian toilets are a nightmare for people
                        with leg injuries.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        There's another benefit of making small talk with the
                        person driving you around. You keep indulging in the
                        back and forth, and before you realise, you would have
                        reached your destination. In front of us was a school
                        for the speech and hearing impaired, autism and people
                        with intellectual disabilities, St. Joseph's was right
                        next to it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This seemed to be bhaiyya's territory. He was doing all
                        the talking and everyone recognised him. He had a swift
                        pace, for someone relying on a walking stick.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The guard tells us the school is closed but we could
                        find Br. Verguise at the church adjacent to the School
                        for specially abled. And believe you me there was a
                        feast going on there. A farmers' feast for the tribal
                        and farming communities of Madhya Pradesh. There seemed
                        to be no dearth of food and drinks, as everyone emitted
                        an air of giddy joy, an atmosphere signaling
                        celebration. Men sported fancy turbans and women had
                        large green leaves pinned to their hair.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We shuffle our way around people and reach the office to
                        find no sign of Br. Verguise, the only people over there
                        pay no attention to us and carry on gossiping over
                        half-full glasses of Limca. Bhaiyya tells me to wait and
                        without waiting for a response, takes off. Within a
                        minute, he is walking back with a gentleman.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Without further ado, I apologise for our intrusion and
                        quickly introduce Behes and myself. Br. Verguise seems
                        to be in a pensive state as I tell him that we would
                        like to invite his students to the local chapter of
                        Behes and further brief him about Maha Behes, the
                        national finals. He hears me out carefully without a
                        trace of emotion.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I gave him a big smile, as he crushed my hand during the
                        customary handshake while bidding farewell but his face
                        betrayed no expression, almost as if he was in a
                        meditative state. Bhaiyya senses I am a little
                        disheartened at the lack of response and decides to play
                        the local guide, totally free of cost, in what I suspect
                        to be an attempt to cheer up his newfound friend. He
                        takes me on a tour of St. Joseph's, which boasts of a
                        gigantic campus.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He tells me he spent 17 years in this school and was
                        very close to the people here, while pointing out
                        memorable spots on the way. He also cheekily admits that
                        St. Joseph's is not much of a tourist spot, we are just
                        taking the short cut through the school campus to Sagar
                        Public School.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Students of SPS had already participated in a Behes
                        Bhopal round in 2019. Before entering the school I paid
                        bhaiyya what was owed, before giving him a behes booklet
                        which had my contact details, if in case he ever wished
                        to crib about his aching leg.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I entered the premises and was asked to sit in the
                        waiting area till the principal called for me.
                        Unexpectedly, the parent sitting on my right flashes a
                        shy smile as we make eye contact, before initiating a
                        hesitant conversation about my hair do.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I deftly steer clear of his attempts at finding out what
                        my parents think about my hair, (and if you are curious,
                        you should know, my parents think I have beautiful hair
                        and fuss over it all the time) and share that I am from
                        Delhi and would be in town for the next few days.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Now, a person must be super curious about Delhi given
                        its active political drama in the past year. However, he
                        was sensible enough to not bring up any of it and simply
                        acknowledged how Delhi had made the right choice by
                        standing with Aam Aadmi Party during the Legislative
                        Assembly elections.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When I am finally summoned by the principal, she was a
                        bit caught up paying attention to the boards exam papers
                        she was checking. She waves me in nonchalantly, and as I
                        place our proposal, she carries on flipping through the
                        answer scripts, scribbling with a red pen in her smooth,
                        free hand movements.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I was pitching for them to host a Behes round because
                        this would be in the middle of the city, as opposed to
                        the outskirts, and if she agreed we would have the
                        luxury of choosing the best location, based on
                        responses.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        She finally kept her papers aside and after an elaborate
                        sigh, she clarified the school is working 6 days a week
                        and she would have to get back to our team. I sensed
                        reluctance and haggle for her permission in organising a
                        session for her students later this month, to which
                        which she readily agrees. I believe that was only to get
                        rid of me, well, I am a smart chap myself, so I confirm
                        the dates and invariably convince her into locking the
                        dates with her receptionist.
                      </p>
                      <p>Aaah, that feeling of achievement!</p>
