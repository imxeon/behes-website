                      <p class="lead">
                        When I first received the invitation to conduct a Behes
                        Boot Camp in Hardoi, a small town nestled in the heart
                        of Uttar Pradesh, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Known for its temples, narrow roads, and warm
                        hospitality, Hardoi seemed an unlikely place for a
                        debating camp. However, little did I know that this trip
                        would be filled with unique experiences, from a midnight
                        train drama to sharing a room with an early-rising
                        parrot owner, and, of course, encountering some of the
                        brightest (and laziest) young minds I’ve ever met.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This boot camp was more than just preparation for the
                        best debate competitions; it was a deep dive into ideas,
                        creativity, and teamwork that transcended geographical
                        boundaries.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The journey to Hardoi began in the most quintessentially
                        Indian way—a train ride. As the night progressed, the
                        rhythmic chug of the train lulled most passengers into a
                        state of drowsiness, myself included. Suddenly, the
                        train jolted to a stop in the middle of nowhere.
                        Confused murmurs filled the compartment. Some speculated
                        it was a signal failure; others whispered about a cow on
                        the tracks. The truth turned out to be far more absurd.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A fellow passenger, in a moment of sheer panic, had
                        pulled the chain to stop the train. His reason? He had
                        accidentally dropped his phone out of the window. I
                        couldn’t believe my ears when the train guard announced
                        this. As the man pleaded with the staff to let him
                        search for his lost phone in the dark, I looked around
                        and saw a mixture of exasperation and amusement on the
                        passengers' faces.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The episode delayed us by nearly an hour, but it gave me
                        time to chat with a group of college students traveling
                        home for the holidays. They were curious about my
                        destination and the concept of Behes. By the time the
                        train finally started moving again, I had turned the
                        delay into a mini promotional session for the art of
                        debating, explaining how participating in the best
                        debate competitions can shape their analytical and
                        communication skills.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Arriving in Hardoi the next morning, I was greeted by
                        the warm and enthusiastic school staff who had organized
                        the camp. The school, a sprawling campus with a mix of
                        modern classrooms and traditional courtyards, was to be
                        my home for the next three days. I was shown to my
                        accommodation—a modest room on the school premises,
                        which I would be sharing with a teacher named Mr.
                        Sharma.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Mr. Sharma was an interesting character, to say the
                        least. A devout bird lover, he had a pet parrot that he
                        treated like royalty. Every morning at 4 AM, Sharma Ji
                        would wake up to prepare a special meal for his feathery
                        friend. Despite my initial irritation at being woken up
                        so early, I couldn’t help but admire his dedication. On
                        the second morning, he even invited me to meet the
                        parrot, who, much to my surprise, greeted me with a
                        cheerful “Good morning!”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Sharma Ji’s quirks made my stay all the more memorable.
                        He also turned out to be an excellent conversationalist,
                        sharing anecdotes about Hardoi’s history and its
                        lesser-known spots, including a temple with intricate
                        carvings that we visited on the last evening of my stay.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The students at the boot camp were a delightful paradox.
                        Their intellectual curiosity was unparalleled; they
                        asked questions that would make seasoned debaters pause
                        to think. “If AI takes over the world, will it have a
                        fashion sense?” one student quipped during a discussion
                        on the Behes theme <em>‘Drip Around the World’</em>.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, their enthusiasm for thinking didn’t always
                        translate into action. Tasks like drafting arguments or
                        preparing rebuttals often required a great deal of
                        nudging. One afternoon, as I watched a group of students
                        lounging on the floor instead of working on their debate
                        motions, I couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re great at
                        ideas but terrible at doing!” I exclaimed, to which one
                        student cheekily replied, “Isn’t that what mentors are
                        for?”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Despite their occasional laziness, the students’
                        eagerness to learn made the camp an absolute joy. Their
                        transformation over the three days was remarkable. They
                        began as hesitant participants but ended up showing
                        great promise, equipped to take on the best debate
                        competitions with confidence and skill.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The evenings in Hardoi offered a chance to explore the
                        town. One particularly memorable visit was to a
                        centuries-old temple known for its unique rituals and
                        serene ambiance. The temple’s priest, noticing my
                        curiosity, explained the history behind its carvings and
                        rituals. “Hardoi is a small town, but it holds the
                        stories of many lifetimes,” he said, his words echoing
                        in the quiet courtyard.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Another evening, I visited the bustling local market.
                        The vibrant stalls, selling everything from colorful
                        fabrics to steaming plates of chaat, provided a stark
                        contrast to the calm of the temple. At one point, I
                        found myself in a spirited bargaining session with a
                        vendor over a handcrafted scarf and even ended up
                        telling him all about Behes and what I do at schools
                        across our fair country.. It was a refreshing reminder
                        of the simple joys of small-town life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The boot camp culminated in a mini-debate tournament.
                        Watching the students put their newly acquired skills
                        into action was immensely rewarding. One team argued
                        passionately about the significance of fashion in
                        shaping identity, while another debated the ethics of
                        clothing production.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The debates were as insightful as they were
                        entertaining, filled with moments of wit and wisdom. For
                        many students, it was their first step towards
                        participating in the best debate competitions, and their
                        excitement was palpable.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the end of the day, as we handed out certificates and
                        clicked group photos, I couldn’t help but feel a sense
                        of pride. The students had come a long way in just three
                        days, proving that with curiosity and guidance, young
                        minds can achieve incredible things.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As I boarded the train back home, I found myself
                        reflecting on the unique experiences of the past few
                        days. From the chaotic train ride to the parrot’s early
                        morning greetings, from the students’ extraordinary
                        ideas to the town’s hidden gems, Hardoi had left an
                        indelible mark on me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Behes Boot Camp in Hardoi wasn’t just about teaching
                        debate; it was about learning—about people, places, and
                        the power of curiosity. It reminded me that even in the
                        most unexpected corners of the world, there are stories
                        waiting to be discovered and minds waiting to be
                        inspired.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Hardoi may be a small dot on the map, but for me, it
                        will always be a place of big ideas and unforgettable
                        memories. For anyone looking to ignite young minds and
                        prepare them for the best debate competitions, a place
                        like Hardoi holds all the magic one could ask for.
