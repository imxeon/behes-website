                        While Behes objectively might mean a debating
                        organization to you, for me it’s the essence of life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For someone like me who wanted to spend her life
                        debating on topics, thinking out of the box, and taking
                        public speaking to new heights; but is now spending
                        hours buried under books, playing with numbers, and
                        dealing with taxes ; to be a part of something like
                        this, feels nothing less than homecoming after a long
                        consuming day.

                      <p>
                        As I go on to tell you my tales of Behes, you might
                        realize that much of my pain is self-chosen, but let me
                        assure you, all of my joy is self-defined too.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        While I continue living my chosen life of being a
                        Chartered Accountant, my inner conscience that remains
                        unsatisfied, quenches its thirst of owning the public
                        space, through Behes.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I have a two sided story with Behes. At the square of
                        completing two years of association as a team member, I
                        have been at all the positions- from being an intern to
                        a team member, from being the youngest member in the
                        team to now seeing younger interns around me, from being
                        highly formal to taking out my fun side; but the
                        transformation that is most special to me is travelling
                        from the audience to the stage.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Travelling to a destination feels better when journey is
                        good; but life becomes better when the journey is as
                        remarkable as the destination!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Let me take you on a tour of my journey. A journey which
                        is full of surprises, smiles and life!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For that allow me take you back to 2016, the year of
                        growth , the year of revolution and the year when Behes
                        made its way to Meerut and fortunately all the way to my
                        school for a mini round. Here I take the liberty of
                        assuming that you guys are well versed with the format
                        of the Behes mini rounds.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I was in my class 11th then, the pressure of selecting a
                        subject stream, deciding your career path and making
                        sure that the career is well accepted by the society;
                        makes you do unbelievable things. One such thing was
                        done by me when I dropped my 4 years’ old plan of
                        pursuing Journalism and decided to read commerce. The
                        older plan was known to all, the latest one was
                        unmapped.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The decision I made that day, shocked many. While some
                        thought I was making sense, many believed that I should
                        re-consider my decision. I was not in a position to
                        answer anything, for when you don’t understand yourself,
                        you can’t convince others to understand you. Many people
                        believed that I had a plan that I was not sharing with
                        anybody, but for the first time I didn’t have any
                        arguments or reasons behind my decision. It was
                        something that I just did without any concrete reasons.
                        It didn’t feel good, but it somewhere, it felt right.
                        The only thing that I was assured of was that I will go
                        for any course but not Charted Accountancy. That was the
                        only “plan” that I had, and that was the only thing I
                        was sure of in that moment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Going down the memory lane, I realize,<em

                      <p>
                        Out of many things that I am grateful for in my life,
                        there’s also a moment that happened just a month after
                        the mindful decision. That day, out of the blue, my then
                        English teacher - Ms. Dimple pulled me out of my class
                        and told me about this Behes workshop she had already
                        forwarded my name for. I agreed to it without a thought,
                        for having a debating workshop in the school, was
                        something I had never heard of.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It was not a big moment back then, but when I look back
                        at it now, it gave me everything I live for and live by,
                        today.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        With the day of the workshop arriving, my amusement for
                        the idea of skipping classes and attending it was gone.
                        I was excited but was not looking forward to it. I even
                        missed out on a few hours of the workshop on day 1
                        because of the other debate I was participating in. I
                        remember being sleepy and unwilling to go for the
                        workshop, but thanks to my over-excited debate friends,
                        I was dragged to the workshop venue.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <em>
                          Little did I know then that I was just one decision
                          away from a completely different life.
                        </em>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Surrounded by my friends, I sat in the crowd and I heard
                        them out. It felt nothing less than one magic wand that
                        shows you why other things did not work out, it gives
                        you all that you’ve been searching for and there’s
                        nothing but happiness and contentment , the same feeling
                        that I get even now. Every day and every moment of my
                        life that is now indulged in Behes.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        That Behes round was nothing but an amazement and a door
                        to a parallel world for me. It was an introduction to
                        the big life ahead, appealing to me; a trailer to the
                        unwritten- unknown story which made my soul unfold
                        itself like a lotus with countless petals.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Behes team then, was just an year old and was in a
                        much primitive stage, with only the founding members
                        working diligently to make a vision come true. This has
                        always been the Behes spirit; you can only work here if
                        you are driven by the idea of bringing a change and
                        serving the community selflessly.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The spirit was same, but the things were a little
                        distinct back then. To quote a few, Salil was thin and a
                        young college guy; and Adil bhaiya had shorter
                        dreadlocks but invariably melodious voice. I did not
                        meet Nabhaneel then, but I am sure he was the same sweet
                        person as he is now.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Those 4 days of Behes mini round were one of such days
                        that I crave for, and really live in. The two days’
                        workshop was followed by a mini tournament of debating.
                        I was doing the impromptu parliamentary style debate for
                        the first time then. I admit I was a bit nervous but
                        that kid inside me was excited and wanted to do
                        everything that she could, making the most out of
                        whatever comes in front of her. The kid that I missed
                        out on for some time in the later years, and miss maybe
                        even now; but thanks to Behes, it always makes me find
                        my way back to her, back to me!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Believe me when I say that no matter how hard I try, I
                        will always be short of words to justify the value of
                        those two days of debating for me. They gave me a lot to
                        learn and even more to cherish for life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        By the end of the second day, “The Best Speaker” award
                        was in my hands; but the title of being “The Loudest
                        Speaker” was something that was given to me by the
                        spectators. Well it definitely defined me more
                        throughout, became more popular then, and is still
                        somewhere a little part of me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The awards mattered then, but what matters now is the
                        feeling that I derive from this association, every time
                        I give something to it.
                      </p>

                          What is the point of giving if you expect something in
                          return. Giving in true sense is the one which leaves
                          you with a contentment that no return can ever
                          justify.

                      <p>
                        Those days gave me what all I’ve now in my life and what
                        all keeps me going. For sometime, it’s okay to not take
                        the calculated decisions and just go with what all comes
                        to your way. It’s okay to not feel good but feel right
                        about something. It’s okay to not search for your
                        happiness, instead, let the happiness find you. It’s
                        okay to let life show you what it’s got for you.

                        I will leave you here with this note for now, the note
                        that I left with from my school that day: curiosity and
                        amazement;
                        <b
                          >“ holding a desire to do something that keeps me
                          excited. An urge to make it to the other side.</b
                        >
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b
                          >For if you don’t know which road to take, but you
                          know you want to walk. For those who walk, will always
                          find the way;”</b

                        so that when we meet here next, we are on the same page,
                        skimming through my life, re-living the moments again!
