                        A few years ago, I left my destiny at the mercy of the
                        ‘yellow wood’ when I decided to take the road less
                        travelled by. Little did I know I will walk over the
                        thorns, find shelter in the rain and well, get a
                        first-hand experience of State Roadways!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        One good thing about the unused road is, you have the
                        freedom to imagine and make your imagination work. There
                        are no signs, no google maps to direct, just you walking
                        and constructing the path for anyone who is willing to
                        follow and make this street a better one.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        My journey with Behes is not the oldest one but a
                        constant one. I don’t know what pulled me here, was it
                        the addiction of dreaming, or the freedom of being
                        myself, or the comfort of acceptance, or you. Most of my
                        time, I feel it’s you. Someday when I will be old, wise
                        and helpless I will be able to find out which string
                        pulled me and lashed me here. Till then, I will use this
                        space to tell you the tales of Outreach.

                        <em>
                          In the last two months, before COVID made its way into
                          the country, I travelled six states, fourteen cities,
                          visited fifty schools, got rejected by seventy school
                          guards and got my phone ignored by countless
                          educators. Welcome to the life of a Behes Outreach-er!
                        </em>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The basics of Behes Outreach needs you to leave your ego
                        home, hold up all your emotions, learn the cheapest way
                        to travel, beg for shelter and most importantly when
                        someone tells you it’s impossible to reach somewhere or
                        hold a tournament in a difficult city keep that in your
                        priority list!

                      <p>
                        On February 3rd, I started the Journey with Chandigarh.
                        Chandigarh, by the way, is also the city that I started
                        my Outreach career in Behes with, and surprisingly it is
                        also the city we had no regional round yet. For me,
                        Chandigarh is my version of Micheal’s Good Place, when
                        it comes to failed attempts and restart. The next
                        morning I was in Jammu, this city calls me so often that
                        I am sure I will mistake her for my hometown if ever
                        Alzheimer’s hits me. When I visited Jammu, the internet
                        was suspended, if network providers to be believed 2G
                        was operational, well that claim fell off the shelf as
                        soon as my bus entered Lakhnpur at the Jammu and Punjab
                        border.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As welcoming as Jammu is, the visit started with an
                        energetic meeting with our Star Mentor Ms Geetika
                        Jamwal. She and her school were not able to be at Maha
                        Behes, so I took the responsibility of delivering her
                        the golden badge.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It was in Jammu, I figured out one skill anyone joining
                        the outreach team should know - finding schools without
                        google maps. Turns out that life suddenly becomes way
                        difficult for a millennial. Thanks to Srishti I was able
                        to navigate via call. Also, she kind of updated me about
                        all the happenings in our WhatsApp group (including the
                        description of random memes shared). Being a human
                        navigator and messenger is just one of her skills.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Following that was a journey on a local train from
                        Kathua to Amritsar. In Amritsar, you don’t really have
                        schools, you have palaces!! No doubt, people there
                        believe in a king-size life. Following that was a visit
                        to Ludhiana to meet our possible host, that school has
                        its headquarters in Firozpur - a border town in Punjab -
                        which was my next stop.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        One great thing about Punjab is that everyone wants to
                        feed you, even the rikshawala bhaiya. And, if you are as
                        thin as I am, brace up you will have no shortage of
                        food, and jokes about you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Next up was the state of Rajasthan. Here’s a warning
                        never travel without checking out the name of your
                        transporter, you may end up in Haryana Roadways and by
                        the time you will realise, you would have travelled far
                        - from atheism to theism.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And if you end up in HRSTC, for your life’s sake do not
                        sit at the back. You may find yourself talking to the
                        Truck driver who has decided to take up the race with
                        the mighty Haryana Roadways.

                        The bus was racing in the middle Kota - A city Indian
                        kids go to lose their dreams, hopes and in some cases
                        life - this driver was overtaking a Tata Indica so he
                        climbed the bus on a divider!!

                        As I freaked out, a chacha near me told me “Ye toh kuch

                        nothing one day the driver hit an old man) while I was
                        processing that, the conductor tells us, “Hamara Driver
                        toda khiska hai, ha ha ha.”(our driver is a little
                        crazy) Trust me, if you are a conductor of a bus filled
                        with freaked out rides that is one fact you don’t tell
                        your passengers, thats like Trump calming America about
                        Coronavirus.

                        Well, I survived Haryana Roadways, made it to Jodhpur
                        and got a regional for you, I think that compensates the
                        trauma.

                        The last stop was the beautiful state of Gujarat. I have
                        been to Gujarat twice so far and I have still not
                        figured out what makes Gujarati so lit up about
                        everything! In my four day trip to Mehsana, Ahmedabad,
                        Surat and Baroda our team was able to fix up three
                        regional rounds. This was the highest point of the
                        Outreach 2020.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Mehsana Meeting with our hosts was on a Sunday, this
                        is probably the first time I met a school who was
                        willing to meet and discuss on a Sunday to save the
                        working days for the Outreach. It may be an unpopular
                        decision to work on weekends, but I think it is the only
                        practical option when you have less time and more
                        students to reach.

                        Ahmedabad gave me an opportunity to rebond with Ms
                        Smriti. Before she got married and became headmistress
                        in an Ahemdabad school, she was in Radiant Patna, the
                        school I graduated from. She was the reason behind all
                        the flawless speeches I gave in the campus, she was an
                        angel helping me in the ideation and grammar correction
                        (Well, Grammar is like 70% of the work for anyone who
                        wants to help me).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I saw her after 5 years, and she was still as adorable
                        as she was back in Radiant. Always ready to help and
                        cares as a mother would. She was also sweet enough to
                        host me at her place, fun fact, next morning I met the
                        Principal of her school and now we have an Ahemdabad
                        Round at that school.

                        Gujarat is probably the only state in India where
                        American food joints don’t sell non-veg, Dal is sweet
                        and roadway’s staff talk to you nicely!

                        When I was back to Noida on 5th March, things had
                        changed drastically in just five days. I could sense the
                        panic. Everyone on the metro was wearing masks,
                        Coronavirus had made its way to my WhatsApp groups,
                        COVID-19 was the talk of the town and in Noida people
                        hoarded all the sanitizers and masks available, so no
                        surprise, for a traveller like me who badly needed a
                        mask and sanitizer had no hopes of finding them. Thanks
                        to the caring and selfless people of Noida.

                        This blog is long, so was the journey from North to West
                        of India. If you have made it till here, there’s one
                        more thing that I want you to know. Had I not made a
                        decision to walk on the road not taken, my life would
                        have been different. Maybe more organised but
                        monotonous, maybe well paid but selfish, maybe full of
                        systems but less of dreams, maybe full of people but
                        less of friends. Had I not been here, I would not have
                        met you; and now when I look back, I feel it is
                        important to march for a cause then just walk to
                        survive.
