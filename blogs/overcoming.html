                        Debating is not an easy activity to be engaged in.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You have to bow down to the whims of the jury and try
                        your best to convince them that you are right. To be
                        told that you are wrong would make one feel queasy and
                        we tend to dismiss the criticism as misguided, when we
                        truly need to reflect within ourselves to decipher what
                        went wrong.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Debating thwarts any ego that you may hold dear, for it
                        purely tests you upon the merit of your words and logic,
                        no flash or bling can ever substitute that. The entry
                        point to the activity may be restricted but post your
                        advent, it's only the polemic of reasoning that
                        triumphs.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I started out in 2014 not really thinking about how far
                        I am willing to take this. Well, it’s 2020 yet the
                        passion for this activity still remains as unrestrained
                        as it was, some six years back.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        People would like to believe that one needs to be
                        proficient and coherent with spoken English in order to
                        debate, however, I lacked that privilege. My familial
                        and academic upbringing ensured that English would be a
                        language employed only in the most formal settings.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The key to mastering a language does not solely lie in
                        the consumption of its literature but in the explicit
                        act of speaking it. Having daily, informal conversations
                        in that language permits one to naturally think in the
                        same language. People who have English as a second
                        language usually translate sentences from their mother
                        tongue before speaking or have to consciously form
                        sentences before uttering them, which is different from
                        what a native or avid speaker would do. To them speaking
                        in English comes as naturally as clicking their fingers,
                        it does not require any conscious effort. A luxury I
                        lacked.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To achieve the same pedestal, the underprivileged have
                        to work twice as hard, if not more, than the people who
                        are privileged.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Do not get me wrong, I’m sufficiently privileged in my
                        own way, with a family that supports my exuberance for
                        debating and coaches who have gone out of their way to
                        lend a helping hand, whenever required, but the barrier
                        of language was one that would indubitably impede my
                        progress.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I had to make a choice. I could either cut ties with
                        this indulgence and accept that it was not for me or I
                        could mindlessly go through the grind, with an utter
                        disregard for what may follow.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I will not sugarcoat; it was super tough, initially. It
                        started with something as simple as talking out loud in
                        my room, addressing the person I saw in the mirror.
                        Translating conversations from my mother tongue to
                        English in my mind, I would visualize myself talking to
                        the protagonist of the movie I just watched.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Having gained nothing but a string of defeats in an
                        year, despite working so hard was heart wrenching and I
                        still do not know what kept me going, back then. Perhaps
                        it had something to do with this sense of meaning I had
                        attached to this activity. Or it was just my idealistic
                        self yearning for a moment of glory, a typical tale of
                        how David knocked Goliath down, against all odds. Maybe
                        I just wanted to prove myself, and my abilities as a
                        debater; it could have been any of them but what truly
                        fascinates me about debating is this little feeling
                        within myself.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The rush I experience when the motion is announced and I
                        have 15 minutes to prepare my case; that surge of energy
                        I feel when I realise I've got that silver bullet that
                        would destroy the opposition’s case or the tingling
                        sensation when my teammate gives a hair raising,
                        enthralling speech and I see the opposition expressing
                        apparent awe, caught unawares.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It’s that period, during the debate, that I cherish the
                        most: an unparalleled wave of fervour swallowing you,
                        sending you to debateland where you forget everything
                        else.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Not that I mean to brag. However, it is not bragging if
                        you back it up, is it? I was Maha-Behes Runners Up in
                        2015 and Champion in 2016 and 2017. Debates will win you
                        numerous accolades if you stay in the field for long,
                        but too many end their journey citing lack of wins,
                        which sounds preposterous.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In retrospect, for me, it was never about the win. It
                        has always been about everything that preceded it: the
                        zeal to think unabashedly and say out loud what you
                        wanted to, without any fear of what comes next. That
                        state of mind, it just cannot be messed with. That is
                        when I feel invincible. Victory is just the cherry on
                        top of a very tasty cake.
