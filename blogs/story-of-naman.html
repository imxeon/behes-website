                        When I think about the power of public speaking
                        activities in building confidence, one story stands out
                        in my mind—the story of Naman.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Naman (name changed) was one of my quieter students, a thoughtful young
                        man with a visible stutter. When he first joined my
                        language class, he was incredibly shy and often sat at
                        the back, avoiding any situation where he might be asked
                        to speak. Even reading aloud was intimidating for him,
                        and his stutter seemed to get worse when he was anxious,
                        leading him to withdraw from group discussions and
                        classroom activities.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The situation was heartbreaking. Naman was bright, with
                        a lot of ideas and opinions, but his confidence was
                        almost nonexistent. I would encourage him as best as I
                        could, but there was only so much I could do within the
                        limits of regular classroom time. Coming from Jammu, we
                        didn’t have much exposure to extracurricular education
                        yet. He told me once, almost in passing, that he wished
                        he could express himself as easily as his classmates
                        did. His eyes said it all—a mixture of frustration and
                        resignation. I knew then that something had to change,
                        and I hoped I’d find a way to help him find his voice.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The breakthrough came when our school introduced Behes,
                        India’s largest school debate platform. I thought Behes
                        might be exactly the environment Naman needed, with its
                        supportive, inclusive atmosphere that encouraged every
                        student to participate. I suggested he come to the first
                        session just to observe. Though initially reluctant, he
                        finally agreed. He was captivated by what he saw.
                        Watching his peers engage passionately in debates,
                        building arguments, and responding respectfully to one
                        another, Naman became intrigued. He admitted to me later
                        that it seemed like something he might actually enjoy,
                        though he couldn’t imagine himself ever debating in
                        front of an audience.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He started small, just listening in at first, then
                        eventually joining group discussions within his team.
                        These low-pressure settings gave him a safe space to
                        speak without feeling exposed, and every time he made it
                        through a thought, even a sentence, without stuttering,
                        I could see a flicker of confidence grow in him. Little
                        by little, he started to believe he could speak in front
                        of others, and his excitement over these small victories
                        was inspiring. Behes became the perfect environment for
                        him to explore his voice without judgment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I began giving him short public speaking exercises—timed
                        sessions where he’d talk about a simple topic for 30
                        seconds. At first, he’d stumble, his stutter slowing him
                        down, but he was determined. With practice, he gradually
                        managed to find a rhythm, and the more he practiced, the
                        better he got. Each successful attempt chipped away at
                        his anxiety, giving him a little more courage. He even
                        began practicing in front of friends and family, a huge
                        step for someone who once barely spoke in class.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The real test came when he decided to participate in his
                        first Behes competition, a local event. I’ll never
                        forget how nervous he was that day. His hands shook, his
                        voice wavered, and he stumbled on his words initially.
                        But then, something incredible happened. As he got
                        deeper into his argument, he seemed to forget his fear.
                        He became focused on his thoughts, speaking with a
                        conviction I hadn’t seen before. His stutter was still
                        there, but it no longer held him back; he was more
                        focused on the strength of his ideas than on his speech.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The support from his teammates and the encouragement
                        from his mentors at Behes made all the difference. Naman
                        walked off the stage that day visibly different—more
                        assured, with a spark of confidence that hadn’t been
                        there before. I could see he had turned a corner,
                        realizing he was capable of expressing himself, even
                        with a stutter.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Over the months, Naman kept participating in Behes
                        competitions, gaining momentum with each debate. He
                        progressed from local to regional levels, and his
                        teammates came to rely on his insights and his ability
                        to frame arguments. The once-quiet student was now known
                        for his thoughtful, balanced viewpoints and his
                        tenacity. When he qualified for the national level, it
                        was a surreal moment for both of us. Standing on that
                        stage, representing his school at a national event,
                        Naman was the embodiment of courage and growth. His
                        stutter, though still present, was now just a small part
                        of his identity—a part that he’d come to accept and work
                        with, rather than be defined by.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Reflecting on Naman’s journey has made me realize just
                        how transformative public speaking activities can be. In
                        Naman’s case, they were the bridge between silence and
                        self-expression, helping him to manage his stutter and
                        gain a lasting sense of confidence. Behes gave him a
                        structured environment to grow, filled with support and
                        free of judgment. It’s hard to overstate the power of
                        this supportive space in helping him find his voice and
                        step into the person he’s become.

                      <p>
                        Seeing Naman’s transformation has reaffirmed my belief
                        in the importance of providing students with platforms
                        like Behes, where they can explore their abilities and
                        overcome personal challenges. His story is a reminder
                        that confidence isn’t about speaking perfectly—it’s
                        about speaking authentically and believing in what
                        you’re saying. And for Naman, that has made all the
                        difference.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Naman’s story has inspired me in my own teaching,
                        showing me that when we give students the right
                        opportunities and the support to grow, they can achieve
                        things they never thought possible. His journey is proof
                        that with patience, resilience, and the courage to keep
                        going, every student has the potential to find their
                        voice.
